Might as well come out and say it right away:  this [book](https://www.amazon.com/Functional-Programming-Scala-Paul-Chiusano/dp/1617290653) is not an easy read. Or more precisely, to really understand and master the topics in this book is not easy, at least not for me.

If you have no prior exposure to functional programming or Scala, this is not the book for you. I suggest you read at least *Programming in Scala* to get the Scala basics down and something like *[Learn You as Haskell for a Great Good](http://learnyouahaskell.com/)* to get exposure to higher-kinded types and to pure functional programming in a static language in general.

So that said, once you get going this is a really fun read. The authors do a great job explaining recurring patterns (functional patterns, not [GoF-patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns)) in code and how these patterns can be implemented in Monads and friends.

The book is written by the main contributors behind Scalaz but this is not a book on Scalaz. Instead itâ€™s a book explaining some of the contents in Scalaz.

My personal preference when working in Scala is not to use Scalaz or Cats but if you do so, this is a must read.

Overall, highly recommended book if you are willing to put in the time to understand it all.
