Might as well come out and say it right away:  this [book](https://www.amazon.com/Functional-Programming-Scala-Paul-Chiusano/dp/1617290653) is not an easy read. Or more precise, to really understand and master the topics in this book, is not easy, at least not for me.

If you have no prior exposure to functional programming or Scala, this is not the book for you. I suggest you read at least Programming in Scala to get the Scala basics down and something like [Learn You as Haskell for a Great Good](http://learnyouahaskell.com/) to get exposed to functional programming in a static language and higher-kinded-types.

So that said, if you have the background and once you get going this is a really fun read. The authors do a great job explaining recurring patterns (not GoF-patterns, functional patterns) in code and how these patterns can be implemented in Monads and friends.

The book is written by the main committers behind Scalaz but this is not a book on Scalaz. Instead itâ€™s a book explaining some of the contents in Scalaz.

My personal preference when working in Scala is not to use Scalaz or Cats but if you do so, this is a must read.

Overall, highly recommended
