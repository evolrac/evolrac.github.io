I was focusing more on embedded systems when the whole Chaos Engineering went viral. So I had heard about the movement but hadn’t had a chance to use it on the systems I was working on at the time.

The book goes through Netflix journey to more on bigger and bolder experiments in production systems:  Chaos Monkey, Chaos Kong, Chaos Automation Platform (ChAP).

This is a short book and can be read in a few hours.

The big takeaway for me was to hear that people are doing this regularly and in an automated fashion.

What I would have liked to see is more description of how to start. A few more practical examples. Of course, all systems are unique but a few more practical pieces of advice would have been great.

Given how quick of a read this is and how important the topic is, I highly recommend this to anyone involved in distributed systems and enterprise computing.

This book is free to download from [O’Reilly](https://www.oreilly.com/webops-perf/free/files/chaos-engineering.pdf?mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiTW1Rd05tUXdZakU1T1RoaiIsInQiOiJ4MHdcLzlVWnJCaThIQzJxK0VTQ2oyZFMyOWhCUjFjSGZkMExSSHpBdUlIMXd6YzQ3S3RBc29vVjVMWGpqZ2xxM1NMaHRPTnRcL1p3RWd0Q3RmeU9NcEtQZW42Yk82Wk9DZkVvOUJDbEgwWjJiTm91WnNRdEc0emsweHhOa09YdThmIn0%3D).
