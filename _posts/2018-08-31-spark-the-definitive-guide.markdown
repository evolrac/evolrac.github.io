To set this review in perspective, I had some prior experience with Spark before reading the [book](https://www.amazon.com/Spark-Definitive-Guide-Processing-Simple/dp/1491912219). I wanted a walkthrough of the whole Spark ecosystem. I read this book by working running all the examples in parallel and I would recommend this over just reading it. Focus of the book is almost exclusively on DataFrame/Dataset APIs and Spark SQL. There are only a few chapters on RDDs.

Overall, I really enjoyed this book. Most of the information can be found on [Spark site](https://spark.apache.org/) but the book does do a good job of telling the hole story.

If there is something that is missing it would be the real deep dives. I would have liked to see even more under the hood explanations but the book very geared towards users of Spark and not so much for developers interested in how Spark was implemented. That said, there are some explanation on how things like shuffling work and how to tweak performance but majority of book is for beginners or intermediate users of Spark.

If you are just getting started with Spark I do suggest that you pick up this book and work through it. Having seen the whole, or at least big chunk, of the Spark universe presented will give you a better understanding before you dive in into your specific problem domain.
