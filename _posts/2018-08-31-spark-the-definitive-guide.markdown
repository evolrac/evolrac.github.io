To set this review in perspective, I should mention that I had some prior experience with Spark before reading the [book](https://www.amazon.com/Spark-Definitive-Guide-Processing-Simple/dp/1491912219).

Note that I read the book by working through/running all the examples in parallel with reading and I would recommend this over just reading it cover to cover. Focus of the book is almost exclusively on DataFrame/Dataset APIs and Spark SQL. There are only a few chapters on RDDs and so if you are after pre-DataFrame Spark this is not the book for you.

Overall, I really enjoyed this book. Most of the information can be found on [Spark site](https://spark.apache.org/) but the book does a great job of capturing the modern Spark ecosystem.

If there is something that is missing it would be the real deep dives. I would have liked to see even more under the hood explanations on the spark engine. The book, however, is geared towards users of Spark and not so much for developers interested in how Spark was implemented. That said, there are some explanation on how things like shuffling work and how to tweak performance.

Majority of the book is for beginners or intermediate users of Spark. If you are just getting started with Spark I suggest that you pick up this book and work through it from start to finish. Having seen the whole, or at least big chunk, of the Spark universe presented will give you a better understanding before you dive in into your specific problem domain.

Overall, highly recommended read for anyone interested in Spark.
