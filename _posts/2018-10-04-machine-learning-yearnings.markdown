Machine learning maestro Andrew Ng, shares his thoughts in this [free book](http://www.mlyearning.org/).  You can sign up at [www.mlyearning.com](http://www.mlyearning.org/) and get access.

To put this book in perspective, I recently read the definitive book on modern deep learning machine learning, [Deep Learning](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville. That book describes in mathematical detail recent state of the art neural networks and design techniques.  Andrew Ngâ€™s book is very different. This is not a deep dive into theory. Instead it gives you a number of practical rules and tips on how to design, test and debug your machine learning solution.

Book is divided into 58 very short (2-3 pages) chapters where each chapters builds on the previous ones but introduces one new concept or tips. Most are standard tricks (divide training set into training, development, and test) but some made me think (how to find the source of error in a trained application).

If you are working with machine learning applications, this book is a must-read. It might not contain that much new information but it is a great read and can be finished in an hour or two.
