I had worked with Scala before reading this the definitive guide to the language so my review is not written by someone new to the language. But that is the beauty of this [book](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Scala-Updated-2-12/dp/0981531687). It can serve both beginners and more seasoned Scala developers that use it as a reference.

As books that set out to define a language go, this is a really good one. It's not a classic like [Kernigan-Ritchie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language) on C or [SICP](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html) on LISP (technically SICP doesn’t set out to define LISP but does so as a by-product).


So who should read this book. The perfect audience for this book is someone who programs for a living and knows how to program imperatively and knows some OO. Ideally they have also had some exposure to functional programming. I know some people have said this shouldn’t be your first book in Scala but I disagree. Maybe that is true if Scala is your first language but then you picked the wrong language. If you know how to program, this is a perfect first book on Scala.

What Programming in Scala is lacking in my opinion is more information about frameworks and Akka especially and the pure functional Scala ideas of Scalaz and Cats. I understand this is intentional as it sets out to define the language but as the comprehensive introduction that it is I still feel it is lacking something. To some degree, Akka, Play, Spark, and Scalaz define what Scala is 2018. So I would have like to see a little more there especially on Akka.  

The second thing that I have against this book is that it keeps repeating itself. There are several separate sections on collections. I’m a big fan of Scala collections and knowing how to work with collections, map/fold/filter and case classes really is what (basic) Scala is all about but it is unnecessary to include the whole API documentation in the book.

The good things in this book are many. It won’t give you information you couldn’t get by browsing [scala-lang.org](https://www.scala-lang.org/) but the book is a lot easier to read than Scala site.

A must read for any Scala programmer.
