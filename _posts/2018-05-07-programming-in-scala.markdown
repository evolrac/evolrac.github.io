I had worked with Scala before reading this the definitive guide to the language so my review is not from someone new to the language. But that is the beauty of this book, it can serve both beginners and more seasoned Scala developers that use it as a reference.
As books that set out to define a language go, this is a really good one. It's not a classic like [Kernigan-Ritchie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language) on C or [SICP](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html) on LISP (technically SICP doesn’t set out to define LISP but does so as a by-product).
So who should read this book. I learned Scala by throwing myself into [exercism.io](https://exercism.io/) exercises, of which I’m a great big fan but I feel I should probably should have read this book start to finish before doing more advanced stuff. YMV, and learning styles for different people are different. Although Scala was an exception, my preferred way of learning a new technology, languages or framework, nowadays is to read up on it first, then  throwing in some quick tests in the REPL. After that you can attack projects with a lot more confidence. The perfect audience for this book is someone who programs for a living and knows how to program imperatively and knows some OO. Ideally they have also had some exposure to functional programming. I know some people have said this shouldn’t be your first book in Scala but I disagree. Maybe that is true if Scala is your first language but then you picked the wrong language. If you know how to program, this is a perfect first book on Scala.

What Programming in Scala is lacking in my opinion is more information about frameworks and Akka especially and the pure functional Scala ideas of Scalaz and Cats. I understand this is intentional as it sets out to define the language but as the comprehensive introduction that it is I still feel it is lacking something. To some degree, Akka, Play, Spark, and Scalaz are what Scala is 2018. So I would have like to see a little more there especially on Akka.  

The second thing that I have against this book is that it keeps repeat itself. There are several separate sections on collections. I’m a big fan of Scala collections and knowing how to work with collections, map/fold/filter and case classes really is what (basic) Scala is all about but the material on collections could have been shorter.

The good things in this book are many. It won’t give you information you couldn’t get by browsing [scala-lang.org](https://www.scala-lang.org/) but the book is a lot easier to read than Scala site.
