After working as a software engineer and manager for 18 years, I finally open up [AIAMA-book](https://www.amazon.com/Artificial-Intelligence-Modern-Approach-3rd/dp/0136042597) again. I did quite a bit of machine learning towards the end of my studies (or artificial neural networks as it was called then) and I wrote my master’s thesis in machine learning. I remember having this book as reference literature and I had read some of the chapters but I never went through the whole book.  So fast forward to modern times, I recently finished reading the whole book in its latest edition. This is truly a remarkable book.

Focusing on the few things I didn’t like first, I would have liked more material comparing the different methods and models. In particular the sections on intelligent agents, MDPs, POMDPs, Bayesian networks, and Reinforcement learning form a cohesive body of theory. Everything in this cluster is modelled using probability theory and it is all about having an agent maximizing some objective or understand its surroundings. So this body of knowledge I think would benefit from being treated more cohesively instead of spread out.

Secondly, there is, of course, the lack of deep learning. The 3rd edition is published in 2011 so the big deep learning explosion happened after that.

So back to what is wonderful about this book. The breadth is outstanding. This book has it all. Hidden Markov Models and Stochastic Context Free Grammars (or Probabilistic Context Free Grammar as the book calls it) you got it. Theory about learning (Vapnik, bias-variance etc), you got it. Regression and classification in various forms (Decision trees, bayesian classifiers etc), you got it. Old AI (GOFAI) including planning and expert systems, you got that too..

And the depth is also astonishing. I read draft of Sutton/Barto Reinforcement learning, 2nd ed in parallel with this and found that you get quite a bit of Reinforcement learning in AIAMA as well.
And this goes on for every subject.
Almost all CS graduates nowadays does at least a semester or two of AI/ML. This is the book they should use.
