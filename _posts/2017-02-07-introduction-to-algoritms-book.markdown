So this will not be a [book](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-third-edition) review like others since I read some but not all of the book back in college. Now some 20 years later, I reread it (in a newer version) to brush up on old material, and to finally read chapters I never did read before.

As I remembered from before, this is an exceptional book. It’s not an easy read and I guess the “introduction” in the title is a bit misleading. There are definitely books with algorithms in the title that are a lot less comprehensive and easier to read.

As far as the contents go, there is a lot there. The first parts (I-VI)  of the book covers the basics: how to analyze algorithms, searching, sorting, lists, queue, heaps, trees, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming,  graphs. The remaining section (VII)  is a lot less cohesive. I did enjoy the NP-completeness chapter although to get the whole story on complexity theory you should read something like Sipser’s book.

To summarize, if you have as a software engineer for a while and feel a need to brush up on the theory and you never read Introduction to Algorithms, pick it up. If you are a self-learner or in college, and you are having this as course literature, you are in for a treat.
